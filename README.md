# Registration - Authorization example

What are possible next steps?

- handle edge cases (e.g. user already exists, wrong password, etc.)
- validation of user input
- store registered users and loggedUser locally (e.g. in localStorage)
- move all the logic to a separate module
- move array of users and loggedUser to the server
- store users and loggedUser in a file on the server
